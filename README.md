# Route Manager

This script manages VPN routes by resolving domain names to IP addresses and updating the routing table accordingly.

## Usage

### Refresh IP List

To refresh the list of IP addresses from `domains.txt`:

```sh
python3 route_manager.py resolved-ips
```

## Update Routing Table

To update the routing table, you need to run the script with sudo:

```
sudo python3 route_manager.py route <ROUTED_IP_ADDRESS>
```

Replace <ROUTED_IP_ADDRESS> with the IP address that should be routed through the VPN. This IP address is used to detect
if the VPN route is working properly.

### Example

```
sudo python3 route_manager.py route 10.1/16
```

## Data

The script uses the following input and output files:

- **Input File**: `domains.txt`
    - This file contains a list of domain names to be resolved to IP addresses.
    - The file should be located in the `.dynamic-route` directory within your home directory.
    - If the file does not exist, it will be downloaded from this repository.

- **Output File**: `resolved.txt`
    - This file contains the resolved IP addresses from the `domains.txt` file.
    - The file is generated by the script and is located in the `.dynamic-route` directory within your home directory.
